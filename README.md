# Tutorials

Welcome to CBICAâ€™s C++ learning resource.

Here, we will be showcasing our seminar series "CPP for Image Processing and Machine Learning" including presentations and code examples. 

There are image processing and machine learning libraries out there which use C++ as a base and have become industry standards (<a href="http://www.itk.org/">ITK</a> for medical imaging, <a href="http://opencv.org">OpenCV</a> for computer vision and machine learning, <a href="http://arma.sourceforge.net/">Armadillo</a> for linear algebra, <a href="http://image.diku.dk/shark/">Shark</a>, <a href="http://dlib.net">dlib</a> and <a href="http://www.shogun-toolbox.org/">Shogun</a> for machine learning and so on). 

The documentation provided with these packages, though extensive, assume a certain level of experience with C++ (familiarity with syntax, mainly). Our tutorials are intended for those people who have basic understanding of medical image processing and machine learning but who are just starting to get their toes wet with C++ (and possibly have prior experience with Python or MATLAB).

Here we will be focusing on how someone with a good theoretical background in image processing and machine learning can quickly prototype algorithms using CPP and extend them to create meaningful software packages.

<b>NOTE:</b> To download any of the tutorials, you will need an SVN client (Windows users can turn to <a href="https://tortoisesvn.net/">Tortoise SVN</a>). Please copy the link and do an <a href="http://vegastrike.sourceforge.net/wiki/HowTo:Checkout_SVN">SVN checkout</a> (this will be covered in detail in the first tutorial) with username and password set to 'anonymous'.

For example, to get the first ITK tutorial, the command to run will be:
\verbatim
svn --username anonymous --password anonymous export https://www.nitrc.org/svn/cbica_tutorials/06_ITK-1_Segmentation/ ${directory_where_you_want}
\endverbatim
